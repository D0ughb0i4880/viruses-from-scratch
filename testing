#testing
if you see this, this is the file including any test coding I put here for tests leading to my new 
viruses and malware codes. You can retreive anything from here that you want, as long as you don't take everything. 
I don't put every line of test coding in here anyways just for safety reasons, but please don't copyright anything I create :)
